          What does PPC stand for?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          PPC stands for Pay-Per-Click and is a cornerstone of digital marketing
          where advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked.
          This model is important in business-to-business markets where
          purchasing pathways are detailed and often guided by thorough research
          and comparison.

            PPC can directly influence targeted customers at various stages of
            their decision-making process, making it a powerful tool for
            targeted marketing.

            </span>
            With PPC, businesses only pay when an interested party clicks on
            their ads, which makes it a cost-effective method of driving
            traffic.

            One of the strongest advantages of PPC advertising is its
            measurability. One can analyze the performance of their campaigns in
            real-time and adjust strategies accordingly.

          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Digital search ads are targeted advertisements that appear on search
            engine results pages when users search for specific keywords or
            phrases related to a product or service. These ads are typically
            text-based and are designed to fit seamlessly with the organic
            search results, although they are marked as ads to distinguish them
            from non-paid content.

          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Display ads are a type of online advertising that appears on various
            websites across the internet. These ads can take the form of
            banners, squares, or other shapes and are integrated into the
            layouts of web pages. Display ads can include text, images, video,
            and rich media to catch the attention of viewers.

          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Digital retargeting ads are a form of online advertising that
            targets users who have previously interacted with a website or
            mobile app but did not complete a desired action, such as making a
            purchase or filling out a contact form. These ads are designed to
            re-engage these past visitors by displaying relevant ads to them as
            they browse other parts of the internet, including social media
            platforms, news sites, or blogs.

          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Online video ads are commercials that are displayed before, during,
            or after streaming video content on the internet. These ads are
            commonly seen on platforms like YouTube, social media sites, and
            video streaming services. They can range in length from short clips
            of a few seconds to longer segments, often allowing viewers the
            option to skip the ad after a certain period, typically five
            seconds.

            Shopping ads in Google Search, also known as Product Listing Ads,
            are advertisements that appear prominently on Google's search
            results pages, typically when a user searches for a product. These
            ads are visually engaging and display detailed information about
            products, such as images, prices, and the name of the retailer.
            Unlike traditional text ads, shopping ads are designed specifically
            for retail products and help users make informed decisions by
            providing key product details at a glance.
