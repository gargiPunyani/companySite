        Content is an important part of digital marketing in web designing
        services as it satisfies the customer’s needs for important information.
        While the concept of creating content is easy it becomes challenging
        when one needs to determine the type of content they want to include in
        their digital marketing campaign. While long-form content is ideal for
        improving search engine rankings, short-form content is the breadwinner
        when it comes to conversions and looks into the reasons to improve the
        conversion rate.{" "}

        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          Short-form content contains no more than 1200 words and this can
          consist of digital marketing content including email marketing, blog
          entries, and social media marketing. It’s an ideal content format for
          presenting important information quickly and concisely, and this can
          result in better conversion rates.

          Why does short-form content result in more conversions?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          There are various reasons which short-form content can provide more
          conversions.

          <h1 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold">Increased readership</h1>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            There are a lot of users who have a limited attention span, and that
            makes it tough for them to read through long-form content. These
            individuals will instead browse a webpage for important information.
            Therefore, the primary advantage of short-form content is that it
            increases the likelihood that the users will read the entire
            content.

        <div className="space-y-3 py-4">
          <h1 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold">Time-saving</h1>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Short-form content takes less time to generate and read, which is a
            big advantage for both businesses and readers alike. The time it
            would take to produce a 3000-word blog post can be used to write six
            600-word blog posts and the same happens with reading them.

          <h1 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold">Consistency</h1>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Because shorter content takes less time to create, it makes it
            easier for one to engage with their audience on a more frequent
            basis. As a result, one may be quicker at producing more blog posts
            or social media posts to maintain an active online presence.

          <h1 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold">Mobile friendly</h1>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            It’s no secret users prefer to access content via their mobile
            devices and by keeping their content brief, it enables their target
            audience to read it on their phones or tablets, which can result in
            an enormous amount of people viewing it.

          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Short-form content increases engagement levels by using direct and
            straight-to-the-point messages. This instantly captures their
            audience’s attention and because it’s short, it’s more likely it
            will be read there and then and possibly shared with other users.
