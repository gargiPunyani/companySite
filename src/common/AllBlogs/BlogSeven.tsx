          What is user experience?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          A website experience that is centered around the user is exactly what
          user experience is all about. UX is about the ease of interactions and
          usability of a website. The key to successful UX design is the process
          of eliminating confusion and any potential roadblocks when a customer
          is using the website, as well as producing a responsive, free-flowing
          website.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          When it comes to UX design, it is important to ensure that one engages
          their users whilst allowing them to easily locate the content they’re
          looking for and perform any actions with ease. Not only will this help
          to increase the user engagement metrics, but it will also help improve
          the Core Web Vital scores that search engine pages use to rank a
          website.

          How does UX directly affect SEO?

          Menus and navigation
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
          At some point or another, you’ll no doubt have visited a website where
          the menu and navigation design were confusing and didn’t look good to
          the customers. Confusing interfaces like that can easily frustrate
          users who simply want to access and navigate a website. This is where
          one is likely to lose their customers without them even reaching the
          content they were looking for.

            Website speed and load times
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Slow website speeds can be such an annoying way to wait for any
            website visitor. Every second that passes, it can increase the
            chances of the user to leaving the website before they carry out
            their uncomplete task. This will have a negative impact on the
            engagement metrics and ultimately will hold back your website’s
            capabilities.

            Mobile Responsiveness
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl">
            Websites and brands that do not offer a mobile-friendly website are
            losing over half of the internet’s audience from the start. A
            mobile-friendly website is also something the internet prioritizes
            in search engine results, so if one doesn’t have a responsive
            website, one could be left at the bottom of the pile.
